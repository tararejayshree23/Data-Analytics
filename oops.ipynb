        "\n",
        "- Focuses on hiding internal implementation details and showing only the necessary information to the outside world.\n",
        "- Helps to reduce complexity by exposing only the essential features of an object or system.\n",
        "- Example: A car's accelerator pedal abstracts the complex engine mechanics, allowing you to control speed without knowing the details.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Focuses on bundling data and its methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class or object).\n",
